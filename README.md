# Homework: React β (7 points total)

## Reimagining Layout & Navigation, Improving Usability Using Heuristic Evaluation

In this assignment, you will explore the concepts we learned in the lecture, titled *[Interaction Design: Structure, Layout, & Navigation](https://cs571.github.io/Spring22/lectures/06-Design-Interaction-Design.pdf)*. Using the principles and components covered in class, you will redesign your implementation of React α. Then, you will put the ten usability heuristics we learned in class into practice toward improving the usability of your redesign. Use this opportunity to make concrete design decisions about your project, to improve your design using usability heuristics, and to build a keen eye for identifying usability issues as a UX developer.

**Part 1** — Redesign: (2.5 Points) In this part, you will analyze your current solution for the React α Assignment in terms of its layout and navigational elements. Then, you will use the principles and components covered in class to redesign your solution and describe your design choices. 

**Part 2** — Implementation: (2.5 Points) In this part, you will implement your new design by extending your implementation for the React α Assignment using additional React and/or Bootstrap components.

**Step 3** — Heuristic Evaluation. (2.0 Points) Review your implementation from Part 2 with a critical eye to identify 2-3  “components” that you think are most consequential for user experience. Focusing on your components, inspect your design, considering each usability heuristic, for any violations of the heuristics.

 
## Submission Details

React β can be built on your implementation of React α. If you choose to do so, remove everything in the starter code and copy the files from your React α project to the React β repository below. When you commit and push, ensure that you are committing and pushing to this repository, not react-alpha-s22.

To complete the assignment, you will need to submit the following on [Canvas](https://canvas.wisc.edu/courses/295709/assignments/1516940):

- A completed version of the handout as PDF as an attachment.
- Your repository name and latest commit hash from GitHub Classroom, e.g. `react-beta-s22-osori, 7a0bc3` , as a comment.


When your assignment is ready for grading, please **submit your repository name and latest commit hash from GitHub Classroom**.
